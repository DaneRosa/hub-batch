On the callout page you can change the color of the submit button for your form. You can also apply any CSS styles you want to customize the form. The container class is â€œ.leadin-subscribeâ€ù. This CSS would need to be written inside your website's CSS file, since Leadin does not have any customisable CSS files.</p><h2>Does Collected Forms&nbsp;work with WooCommerce?</h2><p>Unfortunately, due to the way WooCommerce submits forms, HubSpot&nbsp;is unable to provide tracking for those forms. However, if a visitor submits a supported form on your site, HubSpot&nbsp;will be able to track them on WooCommerce product pages.</p><h2>Do Lead Flows &amp; Collected Forms work with multisite?</h2><p>You betcha! These tools&nbsp;should work just fine on multisite right out-of-the-box without requiring any additional setup.</p>",We've compiled a list of most frequently asked questions we've had from our users about the Lead Flows and Collected Forms tools.,Lead Flows and Collected Forms FAQs,4464196227,articles/kcs_article/collected-forms/frequently-asked-questions-for-lead-flows-and-collected-forms,https://app.hubspot.com/content/53/edit-beta/4464196227
