If you close the popup, Leadin won’t show it to you again for a period of two weeks. We recommend trying to view your site in a Chrome ‘incognito window’. You can also use the “Preview Popup” button in your Leadin settings to view the popup even if you’ve closed it.</p><p>If it’s still not working, please confirm that Leadin is installed on your website. For the Leadin WordPress plugin, Leadin requires that your templates have both WordPress header and footer includes to work properly. We include code in those files to make the Leadin tracking and popups work.</p><p>From within Settings you can change the colour of the popup form elements under the setting 'Button color'. Beyond this there’s no built in ability to change the style of the popup form. You can apply any CSS styles you want to the plugin to make it look how you want. The container class is “.leadin-subscribe”. This CSS would need to be written inside your website's CSS file, since Leadin does not have any customisable CSS files.</p><p>Leadin sets a small number of cookies in a visitors browser to facilitate with identifying analytical tracking. For a full breakdown of each cookie, <a href=\"/knowledge/what-cookies-does-leadin-set-in-a-visitors-browser\" target=\"_blank\">see here</a>.</p><p>Right now, the Leadin application is available in English and the Leadin plugin is available in French, Spanish, Japanese, German and Brazilian Portuguese. We’re hoping to offer translations for the Leadin application soon.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the way WooCommerce submits forms, Leadin is unable to provide tracking for those forms. However, if a visitor submits a supported form on your site, Leadin will be able to track them on WooCommerce product pages.</p><p>You betcha! Leadin should work just fine on multisite right out-of-the-box without requiring any additional setup.</p><p>The basic version of Leadin is completely free!

Every time a visitor lands on your website, Leadin will check for the presence of an existing tracking cookie. If a tracking cookie doesn't exist, Leadin spins up a unique browser cookie for that visitor and will log every page that person visitor moving forward.</p><!--more--><p>Leadin will track the page view activity of each visitor anonymously even before she becomes a contact. For example, if a person visits your website three separate times before filling out a form, Leadin will still include the previous visits in the contact timeline provided all these visits occurred on the same browser.</p><p>Leadin cookies are set to never expire. Since Leadin uses a cookie to track visitors, if a visitor deletes her cookies, Leadin will think that person is a \"new visitor\" next time she visits your site, and assigns her a new tracking code. We do have logic that will merge her contact record with her prior history the next time she fills out a form with the same email though. If you're curious about how that works, checking the \"Contact merging - by email address\" section below.</p><p>Leadin automatically integrates with most contact forms on your site that contain an email address field. Any time an anonymous visitor fills out a form and an email address is present, Leadin will identify that visitor as a contact and generate a contact record for you inside your Leadin account.</p><p>Leadin does not allow you to view page view history for anonymous visitors right now. This is a feature we're evaluating for the future.</p><p>Sometimes a person will visit your website from two different browsers, like a mobile phone and a work computer. Since cookies can't be passed between two different browsers, Leadin assigns each \"visitor\" a different tracking code, when in reality it's actually the same person - let's call her Shirley.</p><p>No worries though, we have you covered. Let's say Shirley fills out a form on your website from her phone. Leadin will identify that anonymous visitor as Shirley, and keep track of her going forwad. A week later, Shirley is checking your awesome website while a work, and she fills out a different form with the same email address from her mobile session. At this point, Leadin realizes it's Shirley again, and will merge all her mobile history with her work history into the one contact timeline inside Leadin.</p><p>As outlined above,&nbsp;Leadin facilitates it's visitor tracking through cookies in the visitors web browser.&nbsp;Leadin will automatically merge multiple browser cookies together, if the submissions come from the same email address. The same is true for multiple submissions on a single browser, aka a single tracking cookie. Since cookies are unique to a browser, if John and Shirley share a single computer their submissions will be merged into a single contact record in&nbsp;Leadin due to there being the same tracking cookie present on for both submissions. Contact merging by cookie exists to ensure that, if Shirley submitted multiple forms on your website using a personal email address and a work email address, they are merged into a single record in&nbsp;Leadin since they are both Shirley.&nbsp;</p><p>When testing submissions on your forms, it is important to be aware of this if you submit multiple tests from one single browser. If you are submitting forms with different email addresses, testing1@example.com and testing2@examile.com, these submissions will be merged into a single contact record in&nbsp;Leadin due to the presence of a common tracking cookie. The best way to test submissions, if you don't want them to be merged together, would be to test in the private browsing mode of your web browser. This ensures that you are given a new tracking cookie for each private browsing session, if you close your browser window between submissions.&nbsp;</p>","meta_description":"Leadin tracks every visitor that comes to your site using browser cookies.
