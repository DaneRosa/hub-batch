There’s no setup required.</p><h2>Does Collected Forms&nbsp;work with my form builder?</h2><p>Provided your form is a static HTML form, wrapped in a HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag and not contained inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, Collected Forms should be able to capture the submissions.&nbsp;</p><p>Some common reasons why HubSpot&nbsp;would not be able to capture submissions on forms:</p><ul><li>Form not enclosed in <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags</li><li>Form contained inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></li><li>Form has&nbsp;JavaScript bound to form submit event or submit button click event.&nbsp;This is how submissions are captured and any other events can prevent HubSpot&nbsp;from&nbsp;recognizing a submission.</li><li>Form was introduced after the page completed loading. Collected Forms&nbsp;scans the page as soon as it loads and listens to submissions on forms that were present at that point.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Learn more&nbsp;<a href=\"/knowledge/can-leadin-capture-submissions-on-my-form\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.</p><h2>Why is the Lead Flows pop-up form not showing up?</h2><p>There are a few reasons why you might not be seeing the popup.</p><ul><li>If you close the pop-up on your page, it won't be displayed&nbsp;again for a period of two weeks. We recommend trying to view your site in a Chrome incognito window. You can also use the “Preview Popup” button in your settings to view the popup even if you’ve closed it.</li><li>If the pop-up is still not working, please confirm that the tracking code&nbsp;is installed on your website.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Can I change the style of the pop-up form?</h2><p>Click on a Lead Flow to make edits. On the callout page you can change the color of the submit button for your form. You can also apply any CSS styles you want to customize the form. The container class is “.leadin-subscribe”. This CSS would need to be written inside your website's CSS file, since Leadin does not have any customisable CSS files.</p><h2>Does Collected Forms&nbsp;work with WooCommerce?</h2><p>Unfortunately, due to the way WooCommerce submits forms, HubSpot&nbsp;is unable to provide tracking for those forms. However, if a visitor submits a supported form on your site, HubSpot&nbsp;will be able to track them on WooCommerce product pages.</p><h2>Do Lead Flows &amp; Collected Forms work with multisite?</h2><p>You betcha! These tools&nbsp;should work just fine on multisite right out-of-the-box without requiring any additional setup.</p>","meta_description":"We've compiled a list of most frequently asked questions we've had from our users about the Lead Flows and Collected Forms tools.","name":"Lead Flows and Collected Forms FAQs","id":4464196227,"slug":"articles/kcs_article/collected-forms/frequently-asked-questions-for-lead-flows-and-collected-forms","editLink":"https://app.hubspot.com/content/53/edit-beta/4464196227"},{"url":"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/collected-forms/why-are-my-contacts-not-pushing-to-mailchimp","post_body":"<p>If you have configured your HubSpot <strong>Marketing</strong> <em>Free</em> or <em>Starter</em> account&nbsp;to push Contacts collected from Lead Flows and/or Collected Forms&nbsp;<a href=\"https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/lead-flows/how-do-i-connect-lead-flows-and-collected-forms-to-mailchimp\" target=\"_blank\">into your MailChimp lists</a> and your contacts are not making it into MailChimp successfully, below are some errors you might be seeing and what they mean.</p><!--more--><p>If your new contacts are not pushing to MailChimp, you can find out what the most recent error was by navigating to <strong>Settings &gt; Email Sync&nbsp;</strong>where you wil see the most recent error listed.</p><p>From within <strong>Marketing</strong> <em>Free</em> or <em>Starter</em> <strong>Settings</strong> you will see:</p><ol><li>The most recent error, as reported by MailChimp.</li><li>A button to dismiss this error once it has been resolved.</li></ol><p>Some common errors:</p><ul><li>FNAME must be provided - Please enter a value</li><li>LNAME must be provided - Please enter a value</li><li>MMERGE2 must be provided - Please enter a value</li><li>MMERGE(x) must be provided - Please enter a value</li></ul><p>These errors are occurring because the MailChimp list has required <a href=\"http://kb.mailchimp.com/merge-tags/using/getting-started-with-merge-tags#List-Merge-Tags\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Merge Tags</a> which HubSpot&nbsp;does not send over a value for.</p><p>HubSpot&nbsp;will always push email address to MailChimp, since the email address for a contact is always known.
