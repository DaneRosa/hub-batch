In this example the popup form will appear on any page where the URL contains '/blog' or '/products'. This would include 'website.com/blog/my-blog-post' and and 'website.com/products/product-number-one' but would not include 'website.com/contact'. If you are using the&nbsp;Leadin&nbsp;WordPress plugin, this option will be replaced with the option to target certain page templates provided&nbsp;by your&nbsp;WordPress Theme.</p><h3 id=""popup-triggers"">Popup triggers</h3><p><img src=""http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/324680/Knowledge_Base_Images/popup_form/popup-triggers.png"" alt=""popup-triggers.png"" title=""popup-triggers.png"" width=""604"" height=""123"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p><p>This setting allows you to choose what user interaction will trigger the popup form. Page scroll will trigger the moment your visitor scrolls 50% down your page. Elapsed time simply triggers the moment X seconds have past. Exit intent allows you to trigger the popup form when the visitor's mouse exits the their browser window (for example, when they're about to close the browser tab). Exit intent can be very effective when paired with the 'Page overlay' popup location.</p><h3 id=""popup-location"">Popup location &amp; language</h3><p><img src=""http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/324680/Knowledge_Base_Images/popup_form/popup-location-language.png"" alt=""popup-location-language.png"" title=""popup-location-language.png"" width=""604"" height=""155"" style=""display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p><p>Next up, we can change the location of our popup to appear in four different positions, bottom right, bottom left, top banner and page overlay. Each has their own advantages depending on what you're using your&nbsp;Leadin Popup Form to achieve. We recommend experimenting with different locations to see which works best for you.&nbsp;</p><p>Popup language allows you to change the language&nbsp;of the non-editable&nbsp;parts of the popup, including the form field labels. Currently it is possible to translate these parts of the form to&nbsp;French, Spanish, Japanese, German and Brazilian Portuguese.

Usually visitors who type your website directly into their browser.</li><li><strong>Email</strong>: Visits from tracking links in your emails. These links might be automatically added to the emails you send from providers like MailChimp. They can also be manually added as a tracking URLs.</li><li><strong>Organic</strong>: Non-paid visits from recognised search engines, like Google, Bing, Yahoo, etc.</li><li><strong>Paid</strong>: Visits from paid search ads that are either automatically identified by Leadin or set by tracking URLs.</li><li><strong>Referrals</strong>: Visits from links clicked on other websites.</li><li><strong>Social</strong>: Visits from links clicked on social media sites, like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.</li></ul><p>Leadin uses two methods to identify the source of a visit to your website.</p><ol><li>The first is by looking for a tracking URL, which is a parameter that can be added to the end of a link to your website. A tracking URL might look something like this: http://hubspot.com?utm_source=facebook&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=xyz.</li><li>The second is by the “referrer,” which is the information passed along when someone clicks on a link from another website to your website. The referrer is the original site that contained the link to your website. If someone clicks on a link on 'cnn.com' to visit 'http://leadin.com', then the referrer is cnn.com.</li></ol><p>When determining the source of a visit, Leadin will honour the tracking URL first. If there is no tracking URL, Leadin will honor the referrer.

"How does Leadin Track Visitors?","knowledge/how-does-leadin-track-visitors","<p>Leadin tracks every visitor that comes to your site using <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">browser cookies</a>. Every time a visitor lands on your website, Leadin will check for the presence of an existing tracking cookie. If a tracking cookie doesn't exist, Leadin spins up a unique browser cookie for that visitor and will log every page that person visitor moving forward.</p><!--more--><p>Leadin will track the page view activity of each visitor anonymously even before she becomes a contact. For example, if a person visits your website three separate times before filling out a form, Leadin will still include the previous visits in the contact timeline provided all these visits occurred on the same browser.</p><p>Leadin cookies are set to never expire. Since Leadin uses a cookie to track visitors, if a visitor deletes her cookies, Leadin will think that person is a ""new visitor"" next time she visits your site, and assigns her a new tracking code. We do have logic that will merge her contact record with her prior history the next time she fills out a form with the same email though. If you're curious about how that works, checking the ""Contact merging - by email address"" section below.</p><p>Leadin automatically integrates with most contact forms on your site that contain an email address field. Any time an anonymous visitor fills out a form and an email address is present, Leadin will identify that visitor as a contact and generate a contact record for you inside your Leadin account.</p><p>Leadin does not allow you to view page view history for anonymous visitors right now. This is a feature we're evaluating for the future.</p><p>Sometimes a person will visit your website from two different browsers, like a mobile phone and a work computer. Since cookies can't be passed between two different browsers, Leadin assigns each ""visitor"" a different tracking code, when in reality it's actually the same person - let's call her Shirley.</p><p>No worries though, we have you covered. Let's say Shirley fills out a form on your website from her phone. Leadin will identify that anonymous visitor as Shirley, and keep track of her going forwad. A week later, Shirley is checking your awesome website while a work, and she fills out a different form with the same email address from her mobile session. At this point, Leadin realizes it's Shirley again, and will merge all her mobile history with her work history into the one contact timeline inside Leadin.</p><p>As outlined above,&nbsp;Leadin facilitates it's visitor tracking through cookies in the visitors web browser.&nbsp;Leadin will automatically merge multiple browser cookies together, if the submissions come from the same email address. The same is true for multiple submissions on a single browser, aka a single tracking cookie. Since cookies are unique to a browser, if John and Shirley share a single computer their submissions will be merged into a single contact record in&nbsp;Leadin due to there being the same tracking cookie present on for both submissions. Contact merging by cookie exists to ensure that, if Shirley submitted multiple forms on your website using a personal email address and a work email address, they are merged into a single record in&nbsp;Leadin since they are both Shirley.&nbsp;</p><p>When testing submissions on your forms, it is important to be aware of this if you submit multiple tests from one single browser. If you are submitting forms with different email addresses, testing1@example.com and testing2@examile.com, these submissions will be merged into a single contact record in&nbsp;Leadin due to the presence of a common tracking cookie. The best way to test submissions, if you don't want them to be merged together, would be to test in the private browsing mode of your web browser. This ensures that you are given a new tracking cookie for each private browsing session, if you close your browser window between submissions.&nbsp;</p>","Leadin tracks every visitor that comes to your site using browser cookies.

"Frequently Asked Questions","knowledge/frequently-asked-questions","<p>We've compiled a list of most frequently asked questions we've had from our users and listed them below.</p><!--more--><ol><li>When you install the Leadin tracking code or activate the WordPress plugin&nbsp;(if you're on WordPress), Leadin will track each anonymous visitor to your site with a cookie.</li><li>Once someone fills out any form on your site, Leadin will identify that person with their email address and generate a contact record for that individual.</li><li>You’ll receive an email with a link to the new contact record with all of their visit history.</li></ol><p>Leadin automatically integrates with your contact and comment forms that contain an email address field on your web site. There’s no setup required.</p><p>Provided your form is a static HTML form, wrapped in a HTML <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tag and not contained inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code>, Leadin should be able to capture the submissions.&nbsp;</p><p>Some common reasons why Leadin would not be able to capture submissions on forms:</p><ul><li>Form not enclosed in <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> tags</li><li>Form contained inside an <code>&lt;iframe&gt;</code></li><li>Form has&nbsp;JavaScript bound to form submit event or submit button click event<ul><li>This is how Leadin captures submissions, and any other events can prevent Leadin from knowing when submissions occur</li></ul></li><li>Form was introduced after the page completed loading<ul><li>Leadin scans the page as soon as it loads and listens to submissions on forms that were present at that point</li></ul></li></ul><p><a href=""/knowledge/can-leadin-capture-submissions-on-my-form"" target=""_blank"">Learn more here</a>.</p><p>There’s a few reasons why you might not be seeing the popup. If you close the popup, Leadin won’t show it to you again for a period of two weeks. We recommend trying to view your site in a Chrome ‘incognito window’. You can also use the “Preview Popup” button in your Leadin settings to view the popup even if you’ve closed it.</p><p>If it’s still not working, please confirm that Leadin is installed on your website. For the Leadin WordPress plugin, Leadin requires that your templates have both WordPress header and footer includes to work properly. We include code in those files to make the Leadin tracking and popups work.</p><p>From within Settings you can change the colour of the popup form elements under the setting 'Button color'. Beyond this there’s no built in ability to change the style of the popup form. You can apply any CSS styles you want to the plugin to make it look how you want. The container class is “.leadin-subscribe”. This CSS would need to be written inside your website's CSS file, since Leadin does not have any customisable CSS files.</p><p>Leadin sets a small number of cookies in a visitors browser to facilitate with identifying analytical tracking. For a full breakdown of each cookie, <a href=""/knowledge/what-cookies-does-leadin-set-in-a-visitors-browser"" target=""_blank"">see here</a>.</p><p>Right now, the Leadin application is available in English and the Leadin plugin is available in French, Spanish, Japanese, German and Brazilian Portuguese. We’re hoping to offer translations for the Leadin application soon.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to the way WooCommerce submits forms, Leadin is unable to provide tracking for those forms. However, if a visitor submits a supported form on your site, Leadin will be able to track them on WooCommerce product pages.</p><p>You betcha! Leadin should work just fine on multisite right out-of-the-box without requiring any additional setup.</p><p>The basic version of Leadin is completely free! We’re working on some additional features that we’ll charge for in the future, but right now everything is free.</p>","We've compiled a list of most frequently asked questions we've had from our users and listed them here.",3565791068,"https://app.hubspot.com/content/324680/edit-beta/3565791068"

How are you supposed to know what is attracting visitors to your site or stopping them from visiting again? It's important your business gives as much information as possible on your website but knowing what interests them and what doesn't can be key to getting their business.</p><!--more--><p>This is where we hope we come in. Leadin is a tool that works with most sites to give you better tools to engage with and understand how people are interacting with your website. While WordPress is a great tool for content creation, Leadin tries to fill the gap for helping you gather and interpret visitor data on your site.</p><p>With Leadin you'll be able to answer two crucial questions:</p><ol><li>Who is visiting my site?</li><li>What content are they viewing before and after becoming leads?</li></ol><p>Your contacts database will show you all contacts that have converted on your site along with their original source type, visits, pageviews, and more. You can go into an individual contact to see a timeline of all of their activity, all the details you need to make your next move.</p><p><img alt=""single-contact-example.png"" src=""http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/324680/Knowledge_Base_Images/contacts/single-contact-example.png"" title=""single-contact-example.png"" width=""1024"" data-constrained=""true"" style=""width: 1024px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;""></p><p>Forms in Leadin are dynamically generated based on the existing forms on your site. Leadin has the ability to capture submissions on most existing forms on your website so no need to change your current&nbsp;website. As soon as you install Leadin you are ready to start generating contacts and learning about the pages they've viewed and how they found your website. <a href=""/knowledge/can-leadin-capture-submissions-on-my-form"" target=""_blank"">Learn more</a> about how this feature works.</p><p>The Leadin plugin provides you with the ability to create a lead flow (pop up form) and add it to your website right from within Leadin. Lead flows can help prevent people from slipping through the cracks by targeting them based on their behaviour on your website, on specific pages or all pages. The popup also uses the contact data to intelligently know when to appear.
